# PigLatin
The program will ask for the user to input a word they would like to translate to Pig Latin. 

FOR WORDS THAT BEGIN WITH A CONSONANT: The program will place the first vowel of the original word as the start of the new word along with the remaining alphabets. The alphabets present before the vowel are shifted to the end of the new word followed by “AY”.

FOR WORDS THAT BEGIN WITH A VOWEL: The program will keep the entire word as is, only adding "WAY" to the end of it.
